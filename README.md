# Decision-trees

In this lab, I implemented a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Tree. I will use this classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then I use the trained decision tree to predict the class of a unknown patient, or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
